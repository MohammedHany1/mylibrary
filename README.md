My Library Project

my library was made with HTML, CSS, JavaScribt for frontend and Python, Django with SQLite for backend

my library is a simple library that provides these services:
  sign up & login system for both admins and users.
  admins have more authority so they can:
    add a new book to the library.
    remove an old book from the library.
    login to the website settings and delete any user, book, or booking request.

  users can only:
    see all library books.
    search for any book in the library.
    rent a book for a fixed duration they determine.
    extend or return the book even if the fixed duration is not finished yet.
